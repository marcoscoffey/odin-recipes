        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This homemade ravioli recipe includes a pesto-Alfredo sauce and marinara. Made trying to recreate the ravioli dish that you get at Maggiano's Italian restaurant. Don't be intimidated by the large list of ingredients, it is well worth it!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>For the dough:</strong> All-purpose flour, salt, eggs, water, and olive oil.</li>
            <li><strong>For the filling:</strong> Ricotta, Parmesan, mozzarella and provolone cheeses, an egg, and dried parsley.</li>
            <li><strong>For the sauce:</strong> Olive oil, garlic, prepared basil pesto sauce (you can use store-bought or homemade sauce), heavy cream, Parmesan cheese, and marinara sauce.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Make and knead the dough, then form it into a ball. Tightly wrap the ball and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Mix the filling ingredients together and set aside.</li>
            <li>Cook the garlic and pesto in oil, stir in the heavy cream, and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer, then whisk in the Parmesan.</li>
            <li>Roll out the dough into sheets. Drop cheese filling onto the dough about an inch apart. Cover with the top sheet of pasta and make a seal around each portion of filling. Cut out individual ravioli, then seal the edges.</li>
            <li>Boil the ravioli in salted water until the dumplings rise to the top and the filling is hot. Drain well.</li>
            <li>Divide the ravioli between bowls, top with the warmed marinara sauce, then finish with the sauce.</li>
        </ol>
